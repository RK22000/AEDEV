# AEDEV

Anti Entropy Detection for Encrypted Viruses

Only a portion of the reports are in the dirictory virusTotal. The actual and complete virusTotal dirictory is compressed in VT.zip

You can read about this project in the [ProjectReport.md](https://github.com/RK22000/AEDEV/blob/main/ProjectReport.md)

I'm not sure what license is appropriate for this so for now I'd like to make it clear that I do not want anyone to use AEDEV to bypass any anti-virus security system.
